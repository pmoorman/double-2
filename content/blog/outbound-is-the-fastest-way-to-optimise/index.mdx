### In this futuristic AI and SpaceX era, door-to-door salesmen still exist.

Confusing, right? Evolution should have killed off the guys that no-one ever liked to see coming. But alas, check any job site and you will see successful companies crying out for more of these sales reps to add to their teams.

So what is up here?

- Outbound outreach is - by far - one of the quickest ways to learn why your customers turned you down, and that information is very valuable.

Customers tell you what they like and don’t like about your product, how much they are willing to pay for it, and the best ways to communicate with them. They even tell them who they are (and not)! This immediate feedback substantially improves what and how you’re selling, so every attempt at conversion is better than the last until your process becomes seamless.

Door-to-door sales is probably the most extreme outbound channel out there. Other outbound options include cold calling, cold emailing, street selling, private messaging on social media, and paid advertising channels - anything that involves you proactively pushing your message to an audience, rather than waiting for them to find you. Even ABM (account-based marketing) is a form of outbound because you develop direct relationships first and then sell. All of these methods give you some form of direct feedback.

### So, what do you do with this feedback, exactly?

1. Detect blockers

Perhaps your product is flawed, perhaps your UX is too complicated, perhaps your branding is tone deaf - wouldn’t you rather find this out at the very beginning? If it is a negative result, you learn your weaknesses and optimise. If it is a positive result, you learn your strengths and sell. Either way, the results are instant and valuable.

2. Target audiences

Outbound marketing can allow you to target specific individuals or companies that you believe are a good fit for your product or service. This can help to ensure that you are not wasting time and resources on people who are unlikely to be interested in what you have to offer.

3. Build trust

Outbound marketing methods, such as cold calling, are a far more personal form of communication with potential customers than leaving a blog on your website and hoping they will find it. They get to see you as a real person and in turn, they are seen on a real, human level. This helps build relationships and trust with your target audience.

Although it can be uncomfortable to put yourself out there and actively pursue your target customers, there is no better way to optimise than outbound. All companies, at any stage, can continue to use outbound to improve performance, but the fast-paced learning and iterating it enables is particularly beneficial for start-ups. That is why at Double we always encourage clients to ‘start with outbound’.

In summary, outbound channels are not-so-secret weapons that you really should consider using to launch and/or finetune your business.
