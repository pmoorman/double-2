  Stryber is a business filled with talent, and that includes marketing resources. However, like many service driven businesses, they were delivering for their clients, not themselves.

  Stryber needed an agency with a variety of skills to scale up their marketing efforts. A team that could blend strategy with delivery, just as they do for their own clients.

    There wasn’t time for strategic deep dives, a backlog of plans already existed. This included projects such as; copywriting for their website, document design for industry reports and animation for social media posts.

    Doubles strategy was simple; do the marketing Stryber didn’t have time for.

quote:
  content: Double became my marketing team, which meant working with a bunch of razor-sharp analytical minds with strong execution power. They came in and asked the right questions, fine-tuned strategy and delivered, fast and flexible. With their help I could do twice as much.

    body: Long sales journey’s create a higher risk of the opportunities going cold. We created LinkedIn newsletter content as well as a sequence emails that allow Stryber to remain in there leads peripheral interests.

    body: Social media is full of mediocre content. Using animation and illustration we created a beautiful selection of creative assets that stand out. From a 5 video series explaining corporate venture building to a comic book style cover for Linkedin newsletters.
