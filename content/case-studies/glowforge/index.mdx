title: Crossing the Atlantic 4
subtitle: The iconic 3D printer
excerpt: Already a major player in the US, the leading 3D laser printer company, Glowforge, was ready to expand to the UK and Europe. Building awareness and trust with these new audiences was the key to this transition.

strategy: Our strategy was simple; take the best parts of the US growth marketing strategy and make them work for a British audience. This meant adapting the tone of voice but also adapting the lead gen process to a culturally different consumer As Glowforge is an investment, the buying process takes time and consideration. So, we employed tactics that would maintain leads at a low cost as well as nurture them towards purchase. This involved crafting several persona-based email series to speak more directly to each target audience, as well as persona-centric ads. Landing page testing and design was also crucial to appeal to British customers and, combined with the copy, all aspects of our work established Glowforge as a UK-based operation.
situation: Glowforge is one of the world's largest crowdfunded products ever, earning $28,000,000 in support for their 3D laser printer. Fast-forward from 2015 to 2021, and Glowforge is being used by thousands of people across the US. This success has been thanks to a great product but also a keen focus on community. You only have to Google “Glowforge” to witness a welcoming wave of supportive makers.So when Glowforge decided to cross the Atlantic and launch their product in the UK, they had one main marketing problem – how can we extend that community to an audience on a different continent?
