how_we_did_it: |
  Glowforge is one of the world's largest crowdfunded products ever, earning $28,000,000 in support for their 3D laser printer. Fast-forward from 2015 to 2021, and Glowforge is being used by thousands of people across the US. 

  This success has been thanks to a great product but also a keen focus on community. You only have to Google “Glowforge” to witness a welcoming wave of supportive makers.

  So when Glowforge decided to cross the Atlantic and launch their product in the UK, they had one main marketing problem – how can we extend that community to an audience on a different continent?

    Our strategy was simple; take the best parts of the US growth marketing strategy and make them work for a British audience. This means adapting the tone of voice but also adapting the lead gen process to a culturally different consumer. 

    As Glowforge is an investment, the buying process takes time and consideration. So, we employed tactics that would maintain leads at a low cost as well as nurture them towards purchase. This involves crafting several persona-based email series to speak more directly to each target audience, as well as persona-centric ads.
milestones:
  - title: Landing vs home page
    image: ./GF-MILESTONE-1.png
    body: Many brands use their home page as a destination for ad traffic. That’s not necessarily the best location, depending on your messaging. Our tests showed that a landing page with fewer distractions delivered a higher conversion rate.
  - title: 150+ Ad tests
    image: ./GF-MILESTONE-2.png
    body: We ran more than 150+ different copy and creative combinations. Thanks to the imaginative Glowforge users, we had access to a huge variety of user-generated content as well as branded assets. The result was a long list of learnings.
  - title: Lead nurturing
    image: ./GF-MILESTONE-3.png
    body: Glowforge were using lead nurturing to guide their audience towards purchasing. We diversified this approach with new email copy, downloadable content and 1:1 digital demos. The result was a steady stream of leads moving closer to a purchase.
