how_we_did_it: |
  Our strategy was simple; take the best parts of the US growth marketing strategy and make them work for a British audience. This meant adapting the tone of voice but also adapting the lead gen process to a culturally different consumer.

  As Glowforge is an investment, the buying process takes time and consideration. So, we employed tactics that would maintain leads at a low cost as well as nurture them towards purchase. This involved crafting several persona-based email series to speak more directly to each target audience, as well as persona-centric ads. Landing page testing and design was also crucial to appeal to British customers and, combined with the copy, all aspects of our work established Glowforge as a UK-based operation.

milestones:
  - title: Landing vs home page
    image: ./m1.jpg
    body: Many brands use their home page as a destination for ad traffic. Thatâ€™s not necessarily the best location, depending on your messaging. Our tests showed that a landing page with fewer distractions delivered a higher conversion rate.
  - title: 150+ Ad tests
    image: ./m2.jpg
    body: We ran more than 150+ different copy and creative combinations. Thanks to the imaginative Glowforge users, we had access to a huge variety of user-generated content as well as branded assets. The result was a long list of learnings.
  - title: Lead nurturing
    image: ./m3.jpg
    body: Glowforge were using lead nurturing to guide their audience towards purchasing. We diversified this approach with new email copy, downloadable content and 1:1 digital demos. The result was a steady stream of leads moving closer to a purchase.
