title: Taking growth to the bank
subtitle: Switzerland’s first digital private bank
situation: Alpian was ready to launch and, as with any company on the cusp of greatness, solid systems of acquisition and conversion needed to be in place before take-off.
strategy: Building Alpian’s audience from scratch required several key components. The brand and message needed to be clarified and reinforced across all channels to attract the right people - leaving potential customers in no doubt about the services Alpian provides. To do this effectively, it was imperative that the website was fine-tuned to capture the essence of the company, and powerful written and video content needed to be created to reinforce it. Once all of this was in place, paid ads and clever product marketing was crucial to capture Alpian’s target audience.
