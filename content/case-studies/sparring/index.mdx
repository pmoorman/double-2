how_we_did_it: |
  Sparring has product market fit in Europe. Their clients love the modern approach to communications and affordable pricing via subscriptions & Slack.

  However, Sparring knew the US audience would be different, so how should they adapt to a completely new region? Could they run ads with a slightly different tone of voice or would it require a bigger change?

  body: |
    Sparring’s growth in Europe was largely due to their connections in the start-up community. Our strategy was simple, build a network in the US. Rather than diversify, which often feels like a safer option, focussing attention on fewer activities will produce better results over a shorter period of time.

    So instead of content marketing or performance advertising, we optimised their  networking materials. We sense checked the proposition and adapted the messaging for a US audience.
milestones:
  - title: Strategy Sessions
    image: ./m1.jpg
    body: We organised the project into 5 weekly sprints and tackled topics such as; cultural differences specific to their market, localisation, the value proposition and key messaging. Each week was finished with a 60 minute handover session.
  - title: Website optimisation
    image: ./m2.jpg
    body: You can’t Google translate your marketing and expect it to work in a new region. So instead we reviewed the Sparring US landing page and worked together with their in-house design team to make a conversion driven solution based on audience insights.
