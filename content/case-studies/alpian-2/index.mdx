subtitle: International leader of robotic farming
strategy: Our approach with Lely was multifaceted. As a well-established and well-respected company, one of our main goals was to nurture customer relationships and establish Lely as the primary voice on the future of farming. We did this by delivering educational and supportive lead-nurturing sequences, landing pages, ads, newsletters and campaigns across several countries. We also implemented new lead capture strategies on their websites and delivered workshops to Lely staff on the best practices in growth marketing.
situation: Lely works in 45 countries and generates 611 million in revenue. A major player such as this requires scalable growth systems and high-quality content that can build long-lasting relationships with a wide variety of audiences across the globe.
